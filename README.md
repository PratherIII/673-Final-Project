# 673-Final-Project
Repository Hosting my final project for MAP673

This page shows data of prescribed burns that have been documented with the Kentucky Prescribed Fire Council since.

In order to build this webpage, I used the BootStrap CSS styling to take advantage of their grid styling capabilities. In addition, It used the layoutit! tool to design the page with a user friendly interface.

To build the map itself I used a variety of tools. First of all I got a Kentucky 2018 Counties Shapefile from the US Census Burea and imported it using the d3. JS library. I used d3 to create and SVG item within my #map container, and also to draw my counties to the map.

Use Getbootstrap.com for help with bootstrap items

Add inverse to raise() function (lower())from d3.API.

Dynamically create drop down items using d3. (Example from lesson 07)

Create time slider using example from https://bl.ocks.org/johnwalley/e1d256b81e51da68f7feb632a53c3518

return value from times slider and use it in another function to hide undesirable elements.
